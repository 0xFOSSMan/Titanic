# Titanic
A QOL client for Legacy Minecraft Versions.

## Which versions will this client support?
The client will support Beta 1.1_02 and Beta 1.7.3.

## Is this client bannable on servers?
No, we are in contact with server owners and plan to satisfy all rules.

Titanic will come with a Bukkit API that will allow servers to stop the use of certain features on the server.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Designing process, would like something that has [Lunar Client](https://lunarclient.com)-like concepts/aspects
- [ ] Create a base for simple features
- [ ] Create the UI framework with different paths for each menu (it will work similarly to how endpoints work in express servers)
- [ ] Implementing quality of life features such as a brightness slider & fixes for crashes
- [ ] Implement a basic cosmetic system for capes only, wings and emotes will come at a later time
- [ ] Bukkit API
